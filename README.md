Major Depression as a Network: Complex System Simulation
--------------------------------------------------------

"In this paper, we characterize major depression as a complex dynamic system in
which symptoms (e.g., insomnia and fatigue) are directly connected to one another in a network
structure." 

--<cite>Cramer et al. (2016)</cite>

Major depression is one of the largest mental health problems of our time. By characterising major depression as network, we could get new information about this disease and find new ways to treat it. To find out more, install the requirements and run the website. This gives you all the information about the paper of Cramer et al. (2016) who first came up with the idea and our own research done on top of that.

#### Requirements
- A Modern Webbrowser
	- Please turn off your AdBlocker for the best experience
- Python 3.6
- Websockets for Python: ```pip install websockets```

Other required libraries are included with the Python Anaconda distribution by default, we recommend using this! 

#### Run

```cd path/to/Complex_systems``` and executing ```python run.py``` from the command line will start the web server, socket server and launch the website!
